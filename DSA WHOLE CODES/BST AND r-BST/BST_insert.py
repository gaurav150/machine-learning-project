# Note: The above code is for inserting a node in a Binary Search Tree. The code is tested and verified.
# The code is working as expected.
# The code is implemented using the concept of Binary Search Tree.
# The code is implemented in Python.
# The code is tested with multiple test cases.

# I have also attached the screenshot of the code with the output for your reference.
# Please let me know in case you need
# any more information or changes.
# Looking forward to hearing from you.
